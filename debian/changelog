debmirror (1:1.0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Remove duplicated checks of md5sums for Packages/Sources files.
  * Improve performance of parsing Packages/Sources files (by a factor of
    about 30).
  * Revert change in directory removal as otherwise also empty parent
    directories of empty directories no longer get removed.
  * Fix support for mirrors with need extra directories in dist, such as
    security mirrors, which got broken by the suite->codename symlink
    changes. Thanks to Christoph Goehre for reporting the issue and testing
    the fix. Closes: #543775.
  * No longer requires a leading "/" or ":" for the root directory. This
    means the same --root option can be used for both http/ftp and rsync.
  * Improve accounting of download size and display in B/kiB/MiB depending
    on the size of the download. Closes: #520487.
