  * Default to --rsync-extra=trace, and warn if --rsync-extra setting

  * Avoid getting rsync-extra files if the site being mirrored
    has --root=/ , as that cannot work with rsync.
  * A proxy specified with --proxy or ftp_proxy will now also be used
    for ftp connections.

debmirror (1:2.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * The main Debian archive has started to use rsyncable gzip files.
    Use the --rsyncable flag when compressing Packages/Sources files using
    gzip after applying pdiffs to ensure the md5sum of the file matches the
    one in the Release file again. Closes: #560326.
    This change may cause unnecessary download of the gzipped Packages/Sources
    files for other archives that provide pdiffs but don't have rsyncable
    gzipped files; this can be fixed using the new option --gzip-options.
  * Fix mirroring of archives without a Release.gpg file. Closes: #561533.

debmirror (1:2.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Support updating Contents files using diff files. This can significantly

    --diff as 'package diffs' no longer covers its use.

  * Don't display download speed if rsync is used. Closes: #422100.
  * Support mirroring specific additional files from specific locations on
    the mirror: trace files, ./doc, ./indices and ./tools. The transfer
    method used for this is always rsync, irrespective of what method is
    specified in the --method option. Closes: #153680, #156564.
  * Ubuntu uses an identical Codename for different suites, so just ignore
    it and use the Suite instead. Closes: #544132.

    means the same --root option can be used for both http/ftp and rsync.
  * Improve accounting of download size and display in B/kiB/MiB depending
    on the size of the download. Closes: #520487.
  * Don't write the trace file until the meta data is also in place, and
    don't write one during a dry run.
  * Add option to use a cache file to save the state of the mirror between
    runs, allowing for more efficient mirror runs. Closes: #483922.
  * Supports mirroring "current" Debian Installer images.

debmirror (20020427-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New Release.
  * Applied patch from Robert MyQueen. Great Kudos to him!
    (Closes: Bug#144726, Bug#12998)
  * urgency=high as requested because the predecessor fixes a grave bug

debmirror (20020424-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * New Release.
  * Medium for this upload should close a bug tagged grave.
  * Fix output when using --progress
    (closes: Bug#127484)
  * Add a great patch by Masato Taruishi, adding rsync support to debmirror.
    (closes: Bug#127844)
  * Use now LockFile::Simple to avoid installation of procmail only for
    having a lockfile utility. It is tested to be compatible with programs
    using lockfile.
    (closes: Bug#128041)
  * Use Compress::Zlib to decompress Package files and others.
    (closes: Bug#132306)
  * Add --timeout parameter. This should close Bug#130679 as it can be
    set and defaults to 300 seconds instead of the Net::FTP default
    of 120 seconds. This timeout is also used for the new rsync method.
    (closes: Bug#130679, Bug#122199)
    Don't even think about annoying me further with timeout problems.
