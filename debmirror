=head1 NAME

debmirror - Debian partial mirror script, with ftp, http, hftp or
rsync and package pool support

=head1 SYNOPSIS

debmirror [options] <mirrordir>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This program downloads and maintains a partial local Debian mirror. It can
mirror any combination of architectures, distributions, and sections. Files
are transferred by ftp, and package pools are fully supported. It also does
locking and updates trace files.

To support package pools, this program mirrors in three steps.

=over 4

=item 1. download Packages and Sources files

First it downloads all Packages and Sources files for the subset of Debian it
was instructed to get.

=item 2. clean up unknown files

Any files and directories on the local mirror that are not in the list are
removed.

=item 3. download everything else

The Packages and Sources files are scanned, to build up a list of all the
files they refer to. A few other miscellaneous files are added to the list.
Then the program makes sure that each file in the list is present on the
local mirror and is up-to-date, using file size (and optionally md5sum) checks.
Any necessary files are downloaded.

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 4

=item <mirrordir>

This required parameter specifies where the local mirror directory is. If the
directory does not exist, it will be created. Be careful; telling this
program that your home directory is the mirrordir is guaranteed to replace
your home directory with a Debian mirror!

=item --progress -p

Displays progress bars as files are downloaded.

=item --verbose -v

Displays progress between file downloads.

=item --debug

Enables verbose debug output, including ftp protocol dump.

=item --dry-run

Simulate a mirror run. This will still download the meta files to .temp
but won't replace the old meta files, won't download debs and source
files and only simulates cleanup.

=item --help

Display a usage summary.

=item --host=remotehost -h

Specify the remote host to mirror from. Defaults to ftp.debian.org,
you are strongly encouraged to find a closer mirror.

=item --root=directory -r directory

Specifies the directory on the remote host that is the root of the Debian
archive. Defaults to "debian", which will work for most mirrors. The root
directory has a dists/ subdirectory.

=item --method=ftp|hftp|http|rsync -e

Specify the method to download files. Currently, supported methods are
ftp, hftp (ftp over http proxy), http or rsync.

Note: starting with version 1.1 it is no longer needed to add a ':' prefix
for the root directory.

=item --passive

Download in passive mode.

=item --user=remoteusername -u

Specify the remote user name to use to log to the remote host. Helpful when
dealing with brain damaged proxy servers. Defaults to anonymous.

=item --passwd=remoteuserpassword

Specify the remote user password to use to log into the remote ftp host.
It is used with --user and defaults to anonymous@.

=item --proxy=http://user:pass@url:port/

Specifies the http proxy (like Squid) to use for http and hftp method.

=item --dist=foo[,bar,..] -d foo

Specify the distribution (etch, lenny, squeeze, sid) of Debian to
mirror. This switch may be used multiple times, and multiple
distributions may be specified at once, separated by commas. Using the
links (stable, testing, unstable) does not have the expected results
but you may add those links manually. Defaults to mirroring sid.

=item --omit-suite-symlinks

With this option set, debmirror will not create the 'suite->codename'
symlink. This is needed for example when mirroring archived Debian
releases as they will all have either 'stable' or 'oldstable' as
suite in their Release files.

=item --section=foo[,bar,..] -s foo

Specify the section of Debian to mirror. Defaults to
main,contrib,non-free,main/debian-installer.

=item --arch=foo[,bar,..] -a foo

Specify the architectures to mirror. The default is --arch=i386.
Specifying --arch=none will mirror no archs.

=item --adddir directory

Also download Packages and Sources files from the specified directory
on the remote host (the directory is relative to the root of the
Debian archive). This feature is now obsolete and may be removed in
a future release.

=item --rsync-extra=foo[,bar,..]

Allows to also mirror files from a number of directories that are not part
of the package archive itself. Debmirror will B<always> use rsync for the
transfer of these files, irrespective of what transfer method is specified
in the --method option.

This option can therefore not be used if your remote mirror does not support
rsync, or if the mirror needs a different --root option for rsync than for
the main transfer method specified with --method. Excluding individual files
in the directories is not supported.

The following values are supported.

=over 2

=item doc

Download all files and subdirectories in ./doc directory, and all README
files in the root directory of the archive.

=item indices

Download all files and subdirectories in ./indices directory. Note that
this directory can contain some rather large files; don't include this
type unless you know you need these files.

=item tools

Download all files and subdirectories in ./tools directory.

=item trace

Download the remote mirror's trace files for the archive (./project/trace/*).

=back

If specified, the update of trace files will be done at the beginning of
the mirror run; the other types are done near the end. 

This switch may be used multiple times, and multiple values may be specified
at once, separated by comma's; unknown values are ignored.

=item --di-dist=dists | foo[,bar,..]

Mirror "current" Debian Installer images for the specified dists.
See further the section L<Mirroring Debian Installer images> below.

=item --di-arch=arches | foo[,bar,..]

Mirror "current" Debian Installer images for the specified architectures.
See further the section L<Mirroring Debian Installer images> below.

=item --source

Include source in the mirror (default).

=item --nosource

Do not include source.

=item --i18n

Additionally download Translation-lang.bz2 files, which contain translations
of package descriptions. Selection of specific translations is possible using
the --include and --exclude options.

=item --getcontents

Additionally download Contents.arch.gz files.

=item --md5sums -m

Use md5sums to determine if files on the local mirror that are the correct
size actually have the correct content. Not enabled by default, because
it is too paranoid, and too slow.

When the state cache is used, debmirror will only check md5sums during runs
where the cache has expired or been invalidated, so it is worth considering
to use these two options together.

=item --ignore-missing-release

Don't fail if the Release file is missing.

=item --ignore-release-gpg

Don't fail if the Release.gpg file is missing.

=item --ignore=regex

Never delete any files whose filenames match the regex. May be used multiple times.

=item --exclude=regex

Never download any files whose filenames match the regex. May be used multiple times.

=item --include=regex

Don't exclude any files whose filenames match the regex. May be used multiple times.

=item --exclude-deb-section=regex

Never download any files whose Debian Section (games, doc, oldlibs,
science, ...) match the regex.  May be used multiple times.

=item --limit-priority=regex

Limit download to files whose Debian Priority (required, extra,
optional, ...) match the regex.  May be used multiple times.

=item --timeout=seconds -t

Specifies the timeout to use for network operations (either FTP or rsync).
Set this to a higher value if you experience failed downloads. Defaults
to 300 seconds.

=item --max-batch=number

Download at most max-batch number of files (and ignore rest).

=item --rsync-batch=number

Download at most number of files with each rsync call and then loop.

=item --rsync-options=options

Specify alternative rsync options to be used. Default options are
"-aIL --partial". Care must be taken when specifying alternative
options not to disrupt operations, it's best to only add to those
options.

The most likely option to add is "--bwlimit=x" to avoid saturating the
bandwidth of your link.

=item --postcleanup

Clean up the local mirror but only after mirroring is complete and
only if there was no error. This is the default.

=item --cleanup

Do clean up any unknown files and directories on the local mirror (see
step 2 above).

=item --nocleanup

Do not clean up the local mirror after mirroring is complete.

=item --skippackages

Don't re-download Packages and Sources files. Useful if you know they are
up-to-date.

=item --pdiff=use|mirror|none

If --pdiff=use is specified and the Release file contains entries for
pdiff files, then debmirror will attempt to use them to update the
Packages and Sources files (can reduce download size of meta files),
but will not include them in the mirror. This is the default behavior
and avoids having time consuming pdiff files for a fast local mirror.
Specifying --pdiff=mirror does the same as 'use', but will also include
the downloaded pdiff files in the local mirror. Specify --pdiff=none to
completely ignore pdiff files.

=item --state-cache-days=number

Save the state of the mirror in a cache file between runs. The cache will
expire after the specified number of days, at which time a full check and
cleanup of the mirror will be done. While the cache is valid, debmirror
will trust that the mirror is consistent with this cache.

The cache is only used for files that have a unique name, i.e. binary
packages and source files. If a mirror update fails for any reason, the
cache will be invalidated and the next run will include a full check.

Main advantage of using the state cache is that it avoids a large amount
of disk access while checking which files need to be fetched. It may also
reduce the time required for mirror updates.

=item --ignore-small-errors

Normally debmirror will report an error if any deb files or sources
fail to download and refuse to update the meta data to an inconsistent
mirror. Normally this is a good things as it indicates something went
wrong during download and should be retried. But sometimes the
upstream mirror actually is broken. Specifying --ignore-small-errors
causes debmirror to ignore missing or broken deb and source files but
still be pedantic about checking meta files.

=item --allow-dist-rename

The directory name for a dist should be equal to its Codename and not to
a Suite. If the local mirror currently has directories named after Suites.
debmirror can rename them automatically.
An existing symlink 'codename->suite' will be removed, but debmirror will
automatically create a new symlink 'suite->codename' (immediately after
moving meta files in place). This conversion should only be needed once.

=back

=head1 Mirroring Debian Installer images

Debmirror will only mirror the "current" images that are on the remote
mirror. At least one of the options --di-dist or --di-arch must be
passed to enable mirroring of the images.

The special values "dists" resp. "arches" can be used to tell debmirror
to use the same dists and architectures for D-I images as for the archive,
but it is also possible to specify different values. If either option is
not set, it will default to the same values as for the archive.

If you wish to create custom CD images using for example I<debian-cd>,
you will probably also want add the option "--rsync-extra=doc,tools".

=head2 Limitations

There are no progress updates displayed for D-I images.

=head1 ARCHIVE SIZE

The tables below give an indication of the space needed to mirror the
archive. They are particularly useful if you wish to set up a partial
mirror. Only the size of source and binary packages is included.
You have to allow for around 1-4 GB of meta data (in dists/<dist>) per
suite (depending in your settings) [1]. Plus whatever space is needed
for extra directories (e.g. tools, doc) you wish to mirror.

The tables also show how much additional space is required if you add
a release on top of its predecessor. Note that the additional space
needed for testing and (to a lesser extend) unstable varies during the
development cycle of a release. The additional space needed for testing
is zero immediately after a stable release and grows from that time
onwards.

necessary to guarantee that the local mirror stays consistent while
debmirror is running.

=head1 EXAMPLES

 debmirror /mirror/debian

Simply make a mirror in /mirror/debian, using all defaults (or the settings
defined in debmirror.conf).

 debmirror -a i386,sparc -d sid -d etch -s main --nosource \
           -h ftp.nl.debian.org --progress $HOME/debian/mirror

Make a mirror of i386 and sparc binaries, main only, and include both unstable
and testing versions of Debian. Download from ftp.kernel.org.

 debmirror -e rsync -r :debian $HOME/debian/mirror

Make a mirror using rsync. rsync server is ftp.debian.org::debian.

=head1 FILES

  /etc/debmirror.conf
  ~/.debmirror.conf

    Debmirror will look for the presence of these files and load them
    in the indicated order if they exist.
    See the example in /usr/share/doc/debmirror/examples for syntax.

  ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg

    Debmirror uses gpgv to verify Release and Release.gpg using the
    default keying ~/.gnupg/trustedkeys.gpg. This can be changed by
    exporting GNUPGHOME resulting in $GNUPGHOME/trustedkeys.gpg being
    used.

    To add the right key to this keyring you can import it from the
    debian keyring (in case of the debian archive) using:

      gpg --keyring /usr/share/keyrings/debian-archive-keyring.gpg --export \
          | gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg --import

    or download the key from a keyserver:

      gpg --no-default-keyring --keyring trustedkeys.gpg \
          --keyserver keyring.debian.org --recv-keys <key ID>

    The <key ID> can be found in the gpgv error message in debmirror:
    gpgv: Signature made Tue Jan 23 09:07:53 2007 CET using DSA key ID 2D230C5F
